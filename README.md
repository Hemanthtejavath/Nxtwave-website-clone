# 🎯 Static Website Internship Project – NxtWave Podcast Clone

Welcome to the static website I built as part of my internship project!  
This project is a clone of a reference website provided by the internship team. It was built using **only HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap** (no JavaScript) and demonstrates my frontend design and layout skills.

## 📚 What I Learned

During this project, I gained hands-on experience with:

- Advanced **CSS positioning** (absolute, relative, z-index)
- **Flexbox layouts** using `d-flex`, `gap`, `justify-content-*`
- Responsive design with **Bootstrap Grid**
- Creating **scroll animations** using `@keyframes` and `transform`
- Styling techniques like `clip-path`, `background-image`, and `gradient layering`
- Proper HTML structure and semantic tags
- Managing **layering and stacking contexts**

## 💡 Challenges I Overcame

| Challenge | Solution |
|----------|----------|
| Background video with overlay text | Used `position: absolute`, `z-index`, and `transform: translate()` to layer text on video |
| Horizontal scrolling without JS | Created smooth infinite scroll using `@keyframes` and `translateX` |
| Responsive layout (mobile to desktop) | Used Bootstrap’s grid system, media queries, and utility classes |

## 🔄 Feedback & Iterations

Throughout the process, I:
- Improved alignment and spacing after peer reviews
- Adjusted typography and buttons for better mobile usability
- Updated animations and scroll speed based on feedback

## 📽️ Final Thoughts

This project helped me **strengthen my frontend fundamentals** and proved that even without JavaScript, it’s possible to build interactive, beautiful static websites. I learned a lot about layout, responsiveness, and how to break down a complex design into manageable components.
